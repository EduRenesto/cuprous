# Cuprous
Cuprous is a command line client for Reddit, written in Rust.
I'm writing this mainly to learn Rust, so the code might be ugly sometimes.

### Planned Features
  * Basic Reddit usage (reading, commenting, posting, up/downvoting, etc.)
  * Vim-like keyboard navigation
  * Image support with `w3m-img`
  * ...?

### Installing
Once this is useful enough, I'll make a AUR package for it. For now, you'll need to compile it from scratch.

### Compiling
   * Clone this repository
   * Run `cargo build`
   * Profit

### Contributing
Feel free to open issues, fork it, send pull requests and everything.
